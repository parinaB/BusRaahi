🌐 Deployment
Frontend

Build: npm run build

Deploy the dist/ folder to Netlify, Vercel, or any static host.

Backend

If you’re using Firebase: deploy functions via firebase deploy.

If using Node/Express: push to Render, Railway, or any Node host.

🔐 Environment Variables
Name	Description
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY	Google Maps JavaScript API key
BACKEND_URL	URL of your backend / API server
FIREBASE_CONFIG_*	(if using Firebase) keys for your project

Keep API keys secret — don’t commit real credentials.
